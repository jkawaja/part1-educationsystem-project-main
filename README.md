# part1-educationsystem-project-main

This is part 1 of a project to create a RESTful web service that will provide an education system to potential Colleges
and Universities. For this assignment, we are not concerned about all of the functionality that it will
eventually include, we simply want to start the project with some basics of student and course
information. A collection of APIs built using Java Spring Boot.
